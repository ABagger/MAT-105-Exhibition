This webpage was created for the MAT 105 "History of Graphic Design" 
final presentation.

I also used it as an excuse to actually learn some of the fundamentals
of HTML and CSS, because it was otherwise not a very involved project.

The main trick I used for formatting the page was the CSS grid property
(shoutout to Colin O'Rourke), which allowed me to create a central line
with alternating text and images aligned to the middle from their
respective side.

Also I made use of the table and table-cell properties to vertically 
align the text within the div so that it stays nicely spaced out.
If I were to use this approach again I would plan ahead to make the
exterior/interior containers look a little nicer in HTML. It's 
implemented a little sloppily. Alternatively I could just figure out
how to actually use flex/flexbox formatting. Maybe someday...
