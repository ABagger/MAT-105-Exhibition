        El Lissitzky, <br>
        "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge" <br>
        1919 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterA.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"> <br>
    <br>Following the violent overthrow of Russia's monarchy in 1917, 
    civil war erupted between the anti-communist White Army <br>
    and the Bolshevik Red Guard. At the time of this poster's 
    printing, the Civil War had been raging for two years, <br>
    and there was a stronger need than ever for morale building 
    and recruitment to the Bolshevik movement. Pro-communist <br> 
    designers and draftsmen such as El Lissitzky took up the task 
    of creating agitation-propaganda (agitprop for short) like <br>
    that shown above to rally the masses. El Lissitzky was part 
    of the Suprematist and Constructivist movements which <br>
    emerged early in the Revolution and made use of largely or 
    totally abstract compositions to convey their messages. The<br>
    symbolism in this poster is clear and immediately impactful, 
    with the red wedge piercing the white circle representing <br>
    the defeat of the pro-imperialist White movement by the 
    communist revolutionaries.

        Nikolai Punin & Vladimir Tatlin, <br>
        "Monument III Internationale" <br>
        1920 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterB.jpg" height="300" width="auto" 
    alt="Monument III Internationale"> <br>
    <br> Depicted in this poster is a proposed, but never constructed
    monument to the Third International (a.k.a. the Communist International) <br> 
    which had been founded a year earlier. Nikolai Punin's depiction of 
    Tatlin's planned structure is decidedly Constructivist, but it does <br>
    appear to have been influenced by the Dada movement which arose 
    after the onset of the first World War. The superposition of images <br>
    and text, while not necessarily unique to Dada, was a popular technique 
    within the movement, and the Dada movement had similarly <br> 
    radical, left-wing underpinnings.

        Aleksei Aleksandrovich Radakov, <br>
        "The Illiterate is Like a Blind Man" <br>
        1920 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterC.jpg" height="300" width="auto" 
    alt="The Illiterate is Like a Blind Man"> <br>
    <br> This poster from the same year is advocating for the education 
    of the general public. Prior to the Revolution, the population of<br>
    Russia was predominantly peasant farmers with little if anything in
    the way of formal schooling.  As a result, one of the key aims of <br>
    the revolutionaries was to improve the material and social conditions 
    for workers throughout the country by providing things like free <br>
    public education. The poster itself draws heavily on lubki, a traditional
    style of russian woodblock prints, often depicting popular stories <br>
    and folk tales. This decision was likely a deliberate attempt by Radakov
    to create an image that was at once familiar and relatable to <br>
    its audience, who may have had limited literacy.

        Dmitri Moor, 
        "Have You Registered as a Volunteer?"" <br>
        1920 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterD.png" height="300" width="auto" 
    alt="Have You Registered as a Volunteer?"> <br>
    <br>In the same fashion as many WWI recruitment posters, this piece 
    makes a direct appeal to its audience, asking that they take up arms <br>
    for the workers' movement. While the similarity to other such posters 
    is striking, in this instance it is done in the usual Bolshevik style <br>
    involving the heavy use of red ink, which was cheap as well as symbolic 
    of the socialist cause. This poster also features a backdrop of bustling <br>
    factories representing the recent and rapid modernization of industry 
    which was occurring in the Bolshevik-controlled portion of the country.

        Ivan Vasilyevich Simakov, <br>
        "Long Live the Fifth Anniversary of
        the Great Proletarian Revolution" <br>
        1922 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterE.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="5th Anniversary of the Revolution"> <br>
    <br>By 1922 the Russian Civil War was finally beginning to wind down, 
    and the treaty that officially established the USSR was approved. <br>
    In this poster we see a worker triumphantly holding up the hammer 
    and sickle which became synonymous with the Union. Behind him, <br> 
    workers of seemingly every ethnicity holding red flags alongside major 
    landmarks of several countries are depicted implying <br> 
    a global revolution which was never to come to fruition.

        Alexander Rodchenko,<br> 
        "Dobrolet (Poster for a Russian state airline)" <br>
        1923 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterF.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="(Poster for a Russian state airline)"> <br>
    <br> In 1923 the Russian Revolution finally ended. No longer was 
    the chief aim of poster designers agitation and recruitment of <br>
    workers to the cause. Now designers, like Constructivist Alexander 
    Rodchenko, set about creating advertisements for state industries. <br>
    In this poster we can see an airplane surrounded by abstract red 
    and black shapes as well as important information about the airline<br> 
    itself. Many posters of this nature were produced for a wide range 
    of products and services.

        Alexander Rodchenko,<br>
        "Books (Please)! In All Branches of Knowledge" <br>
        1924 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterG.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="Books! In All Branches of Knowledge"> <br>
    <br> Rodchenko designed this poster to advertise the Leningrad 
    Publishing House. In its shape we can see the same motif of the <br>
    red wedge and the circle from El Lissitzky's famous work. Once again, 
    within the Russian communist movement there was a massive push <br>
    for widespread public education, and of particular note here 
    is that the peasant depicted here calling for books is a woman. <br>
    Under the Russian monarchy, women's roles within society were 
    generally limited to housework and childrearing and so after rising <br>
    to power the Bolsheviks used universal education as one way to 
    help bring about greater gender equality.

        Valentin Shcherbakov,<br>
        "A Spectre Is Haunting Europe, the Spectre of Communism" <br>
        1924 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterH.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="A Spectre Is Haunting Europe"> <br>
    <br> Vladimir Lenin died on January 21st of 1924, and his position 
    as leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union was filled <br>
    by Joseph Stalin. This poster depicts Lenin standing above a banner 
    with the opening line of Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, <br>
    pointing straight ahead with factories in the background. Of note here 
    is the style in which this poster is rendered. An idealized form of<br> 
    realism is used here which became appropriately known as Sociualist 
    Realism. Following Lenin's passing, there was a much greater emphasis<br> 
    placed on deification of “heroes” of the Revolution, and a growing 
    distaste for non-representational styles.

        Nikolai Alekseivich Valerianov,<br> 
        "Female workers and peasants, make your way to the voting booth!<br> 
        Under the red banner, in the same ranks as the men, we inspire <br>
        fear in the bourgeoisie!" <br>
        1925 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterI.png" height="300" width="auto" 
    alt="Make your way to the voting booth!"> <br>
    <br>As part of the Bolsheviks attempt to further consolidate their 
    power going into the election of 1925, the party needed to ensure<br>
    sufficient voter turnout in their favor. We can see designers like 
    Valerianov once again drawing on the theme of political and <br>
    social equality of women to rally female voters' support in the election. 
    Here women are depicted marching confidently with a stereotypically <br>
    portrayed member of the bourgeoisie clearly very dismayed by this. 
    Scenes like this were very common in Soviet posters, and as the Union<br>
    became increasingly modernized, scenarios like these were featured in 
    popular films as well.

        Anonymous (Russian State Library, Moscow),<br>
        "We Smite the Lazy Worker" <br>
        1931 <br>
    <img src="./assets/PosterJ.jpg" height="200" width="auto" 
    alt="We Smite the Lazy Worker"> <br>
    <br> In this final poster, we can see a noticeable shift towards a more 
    aggressive tone in the message being conveyed. Whereas before, <br>
    aggression was directed either towards a political enemy, or the 
    wealthy elite generally, now there is seemingly a veiled threat to <br>
    the workers themselves, Even though the message is intended to be metaphorical, 
    it is a definite departure from the veneration of the proletariat <br>
    that occurred in prior posters, and represents an increase in the authoritarianism 
    of the Soviet state under Stalin. Stylistically, there is <br>
    still a strong Constructivist basis, although it is worth noting 
    that as time went on the Soviet Union became increasingly <br>
    intolerant of more abstract styles, preferring the Socialist 
    Realism we see in the poster of Vladimir Lenin from above.
