    <h1>A Revolution in Posters</h1>
    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">An Exhibition by Andrew Bagger</h3>
    <hr>
    <div id="Prologue">
        &emsp; The Revolution was a time of great upheaval in Russia, both politically and 
        culturally. The Bolsheviks realized in the early days of the movement that 
        there was a strong need to craft a favorable image of the party in order to 
        garner support from people at home and abroad. Among other things, this led 
        to an explosion in the fields of design and art, as Russian artists and draftsmen 
        looking to aid the Revolution began creating propaganda en masse.
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp; A Revolution in Posters explores how long-standing Russian artistic traditions 
        were utilized alongside brand new styles to create propaganda that was both 
        effective and eye-catching. By using well established themes and subject matter, 
        artists could ground the posters in the familiar, and make them more immediately 
        recognizable to their intended audience; by using elements that were more novel 
        and modern, artists could help to create a new Russian identity that better exemplified 
        the ideals of their revolution.
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp; This exhibit looks at propaganda posters from various points in the time period 
        to showcase how their styles and messages shifted and morphed along with the 
        needs of the Bolsheviks. It aims to provide a window into the frenzy of revolution 
        that swept through Russia during the early 20th century and to provide some historical 
        and visual context to anyone interested in history, political theory, graphic 
        design, or any combination thereof.

                    Following the violent overthrow of Russia's monarchy in 1917, 
                    civil war erupted between the anti-communist White Army
                    and the Bolshevik Red Guard. At the time of this poster's 
                    printing, the Civil War had been raging for two years,
                    and there was a stronger need than ever for morale building 
                    and recruitment to the Bolshevik movement. Pro-communist 
                    designers and draftsmen such as El Lissitzky took up the task 
                    of creating agitation-propaganda (agitprop for short) like 
                    that shown above to rally the masses. El Lissitzky was part 
                    of the Suprematist and Constructivist movements which 
                    emerged early in the Revolution and made use of largely or 
                    totally abstract compositions to convey their messages. The
                    symbolism in this poster is clear and immediately impactful, 
                    with the red wedge piercing the white circle representing 
                    the defeat of the pro-imperialist White movement by the 
                    communist revolutionaries.

                    Depicted in this poster is a proposed, but never constructed
                    monument to the Third International (a.k.a. the Communist 
                    International) which had been founded a year earlier. Nikolai 
                    Punin's depiction of Tatlin's planned structure is decidedly 
                    Constructivist, but it does appear to have been influenced by 
                    the Dada movement which arose after the onset of the first World 
                    War. The superposition of images and text, while not necessarily 
                    unique to Dada, was a popular technique within the movement, 
                    and the Dada movement had similarly radical, left-wing 
                    underpinnings.

                This poster from the same year is advocating for the education 
                of the general public. Prior to the Revolution, the population of
                Russia was predominantly peasant farmers with little if anything in
                the way of formal schooling.  As a result, one of the key aims of 
                the revolutionaries was to improve the material and social conditions 
                for workers throughout the country by providing things like free 
                public education. The poster itself draws heavily on lubki, a 
                traditional style of russian woodblock prints, often depicting 
                popular stories and folk tales. This decision was likely a deliberate 
                attempt by Radakov to create an image that was at once familiar 
                and relatable to its audience, who may have had limited literacy.

                    In the same fashion as many WWI recruitment posters, this piece 
                    makes a direct appeal to its audience, asking that they take up arms 
                    for the workers' movement. While the similarity to other such posters 
                    is striking, in this instance it is done in the usual Bolshevik style 
                    involving the heavy use of red ink, which was cheap as well as symbolic 
                    of the socialist cause. This poster also features a backdrop of bustling 
                    factories representing the recent and rapid modernization of industry 
                    which was occurring in the Bolshevik-controlled portion of the country.

                    By 1922 the Russian Civil War was finally beginning to wind down, 
                    and the treaty that officially established the USSR was approved.
                    In this poster we see a worker triumphantly holding up the hammer 
                    and sickle which became synonymous with the Union. Behind him, 
                    workers of seemingly every ethnicity holding red flags alongside 
                    major landmarks of several countries are depicted implying 
                    a global revolution which was never to come to fruition.

                    In 1923 the Russian Revolution finally ended. No longer was 
                    the chief aim of poster designers agitation and recruitment of
                    workers to the cause. Now designers, like Constructivist Alexander 
                    Rodchenko, set about creating advertisements for state industries.
                    In this poster we can see an airplane surrounded by abstract red 
                    and black shapes as well as important information about the airline
                    itself. Many posters of this nature were produced for a wide range 
                    of products and services.

                    Rodchenko designed this poster to advertise the Leningrad 
                    Publishing House. In its shape we can see the same motif of the
                    red wedge and the circle from El Lissitzky's famous work. Once 
                    again, within the Russian communist movement there was a massive 
                    push for widespread public education, and of particular note here 
                    is that the peasant depicted here calling for books is a woman.
                    Under the Russian monarchy, women's roles within society were 
                    generally limited to housework and childrearing and so after 
                    rising to power the Bolsheviks used universal education as one 
                    way to help bring about greater gender equality.

                    Vladimir Lenin died on January 21st of 1924, and his position 
                    as leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union was filled
                    by Joseph Stalin. This poster depicts Lenin standing above a banner 
                    with the opening line of Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, 
                    pointing straight ahead with factories in the background. Of note here 
                    is the style in which this poster is rendered. An idealized form of
                    realism is used here which became appropriately known as Sociualist 
                    Realism. Following Lenin's passing, there was a much greater emphasis
                    placed on deification of “heroes” of the Revolution, and a growing 
                    distaste for non-representational styles.

                    As part of the Bolsheviks attempt to further consolidate their 
                    power going into the election of 1925, the party needed to ensure
                    sufficient voter turnout in their favor. We can see designers like 
                    Valerianov once again drawing on the theme of political and
                    social equality of women to rally female voters' support in the election. 
                    Here women are depicted marching confidently with a stereotypically
                    portrayed member of the bourgeoisie clearly very dismayed by this. 
                    Scenes like this were very common in Soviet posters, and as the Union
                    became increasingly modernized, scenarios like these were featured in 
                    popular films as well.

                    In this final poster, we can see a noticeable shift towards a 
                    more aggressive tone in the message being conveyed. Whereas before,
                    aggression was directed either towards a political enemy, or the 
                    wealthy elite generally, now there is seemingly a veiled threat to
                    the workers themselves. Even though the message is intended to be 
                    metaphorical, it is a definite departure from the veneration of the 
                    proletariat that occurred in prior posters, and represents an increase 
                    in the authoritarianism of the Soviet state under Stalin. Stylistically, 
                    there is still a strong Constructivist basis, although it is worth 
                    noting that as time went on the Soviet Union became increasingly
                    intolerant of more abstract styles, preferring the Socialist 
                    Realism we see in the poster of Vladimir Lenin from above.
